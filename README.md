# Database-project

A personal project developed in 2017. Goal was to use Python, XAMPP and PyMySQL for a local store database. You can find a more extensive explanation in Project.pdf (in Greek), but even from the pictures in the pdf you might get a good grasp of what was accomplished.

Brief explanation in english:
- Contains ER model design as well as the Schema for the SQL database.
- Most default entry values are randomly generated for the sake of the use case.
- Through the python application you can:
  - Insert sql commands directly through the terminal
  - Query the tables
  - Validate transactions
  - Check for item shortages in the store
